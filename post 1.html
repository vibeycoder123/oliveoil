      Tasting olive oil is an experience, not just a step in cooking. Start by pouring a small amount into a cup or spoon and bring it gently to your nose. Notice the aroma: fruity, grassy, nutty, or peppery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a small sip, let the oil coat your tongue, and swallow slowly. Pay attention to bitterness and the slight peppery finish — these are signs of freshness and quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compare different oils side by side to learn their subtle differences. Over time, your palate will recognize regions, harvests, and varieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, tasting is about slowing down and enjoying every layer of flavor. Olive oil deserves this quiet attention, much like a fine wine.
